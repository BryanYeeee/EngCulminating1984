                Eurasian rocket bombs are drastically becoming more frequent in their attempt to breach our impenetrable borders.

                Eurasia’s orchestrated bombardments leave hospitals, stores, and office buildings completely destroyed.

                All the banners around the square had been sabotaged and were decorated all wrong.
